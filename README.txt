The purpose of these files is to input the NYC Rolling Housing Sales data for Brooklyn into RStudio and clean up the raw data.  Missing values were removed, as were items which had a sale price of less than $100,000 (indicating that it was not an actual sale).

The file R_rollingsales_brooklyn.R shows the clean-up steps.  Original input data can be found in rollingsales_brooklyn.csv. 

Observations on this dataset can be seen in Brooklyn_rollingsales_obs.txt.
